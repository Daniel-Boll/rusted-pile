Rusted Pile is a stack-based programming language compiler written in Rust. 
It is designed to allow for efficient and concise programming using stack-based operations.

## Installation

To install Rusted Pile, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. Once you have Rust installed, you can use Cargo to build and install the compiler:

```ruby
cargo install rusted_pile
```

## Usage
To compile a Rusted Pile program, simply run the rusted_pile command followed by the name of the source file:

```ruby
rusted_pile my_program.rp
```

This will compile the my_program.rp file and output the resulting executable file.

## Language Features

Rusted Pile includes a number of stack-based operations, including:

- `push`: pushes a value onto the stack
- `pop`: removes the top value from the stack
- `dup`: duplicates the top value on the stack
- `swap`: swaps the top two values on the stack
- `add`: adds the top two values on the stack
- `sub`: subtracts the top two values on the stack
- `mul`: multiplies the top two values on the stack
- `div`: divides the top two values on the stack
